# Facilitation Support

- we have a limited number of highly experienced and endorsed convergent facilitation facilitators
- convergent facilitation is an immensely tough skill to learn and we want to use every opportunity to build more convergent facilitation capacity, therefore:
    - for every project that we support there will be 1-2 CF apprentices joining the experienced facilitator during the process
    - for every project we want to record the session and make them available to a extended group of other CF facilitator and apprentice for learning
        - we might make an exception of this for a project that has super sensitive information and is yet important enough for us to support
