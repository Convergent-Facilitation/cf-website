## Stay in the Loop

We have two options for the newsletter. One is very frequent, and offers as much information as possible (the low threshold version). With the other one we are trying to care for people who's inbox holds already more than they can read, and we intend to only send 3-6 newsletter a year to let you know about important developments and special events (the high threshold version).

:::tip Learn Convergent Facilitation
Thresholds is a key technique used in Convergent Facilitation to effectively lead a group through a decision making process and find an outcome that everyone is truly willing to accept.
:::

### Low Threshold Newsletter

**All events, updates, experiences (~ 25x / year)**: Receive updates on upcoming Convergent Facilitation events as well as new resources. We are usually sending one every other week. If you are signing up for the Low Threshold Newsletter there is no need to also sign up for the High Threshold Newsletter.

### High Threshold Newsletter

**Important only: Updates on the community and special resources and events (~ 3-6x / year)**: We intending to send one about every four months and whenever some special event is coming up that we want everyone to be aware of.

**note: second sign up form here is still missing**
