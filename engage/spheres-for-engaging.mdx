# Spheres for Engaging

:::tip Learn Convergent Facilitation
**Whatever you do, do it _with_ someone. It is a first and easy step to subvert the current norm of hyper indepedence and self-sufficiency.**
:::

We currently envision three different spheres for people to engage with Convergent Facilitation. The outer and most accessible sphere is the _Experience and Apply_ sphere. It's focus lies on learning with existing resources and bring Convergent Facilitation into whatever you are already doing in your life. The _Practice and Co-Create_ sphere asks for deeper engagement with the Convergent Facilitation community and focuses using our own challenges to create new Convergent Facilitation resources. Finally, the "Teach and Steward" is the one that holds Convergent Facilitation as a whole by cares for its integrity and stewarding its development and application.
