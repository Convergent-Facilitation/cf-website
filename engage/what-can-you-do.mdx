# What can you do?

We currently envision three different spheres for people to engage with Convergent Facilitation.

---- 

### :large_yellow_circle: Experience and Embody :deciduous_tree:

The outer and most accessible sphere is the *Experience and Embody* sphere. It's focus lies on getting familiar with Convergent Facilitation by engaging with existing learning resources and joining scheduled events like courses, workshops, coaching calls or practice groups.

#### Goals
- Get to know Convergent Facilitation and experience the power of integrative decision making 
- Practice Convergent Facilitation in safe spaces with other members of the learning community
- Start embodying the principles of Convergent Facilitation in your daily life

### :red_circle: Apply and Apprentice :herb:

The _Apply and Apprentice_ sphere focuses on applying Convergent Facilitation within a web of apprentices and experienced Convergent Facilitation practioners. You are invited to bring your challenges to the community and to receive support to join us in co-creating a powerful Convergent Facilitation learning community and resource library.

#### Goals
- Go out and apply Convergent Facilitation supported by powerful web of other practioners
- Deepen your Convergent Facilitation skills by apprenticing with experienced Convergent Facilitation practioners
- Co-Create a powerful library of publicly avabilable coaching calls by bringing your real-life challenges into the community
- Support others in practicing Convergent Facilitation by offering Practice Group sessions
- Bring your challenges and learnings back to the Community

:point_right:  **Get started with the [Apply and Apprentice](/engage/apply-and-apprentice/intro) sphere**

### :large_purple_circle: Coach and Teach :seedling: 

The _Coach and Teach_ sphere holds the lineage of Convergent Facilitation originating from Miki Kasthan. This sphere is contained within the [Nonviolent Global Liberation Community](https://nglcommunity.org). People teaching Convergent Facilitation and offering coaching calls are offering these from within this sphere. Those who want to become Convergent Facilitation providers ... something about the lineage experiment and this isn't yet open. 


#### Goals
- To care for the development, integrity and rigor of Convergent Facilitation 
- To anchor Convergent Facilitation deeply within nonviolence
- To offer Coaching Calls to practioners and apprentices
- To offer introductory and deepening courses and workshops

:point_right:  **Get started with the [Teach and Steward](/engage/teach-and-steward/intro) sphere**

----

### :large_blue_diamond: Steward and Contribute :scales:

The stewarding of Convergent Facilitation itself as well as the community is held by the Convergent Facilitation Holding team from within the Nonviolent Global Liberation (NGL) Community. The team is currently complete and not looking for new members. Team meetings can be observed by all members of the NGL community (anyone can become a friend). 

In addition to the Holding team a number sub-teams exist that members of the Convergent Facilitation community can also join without being part of NGL. 

#### Purpose

*To mobilize as much movement as possible toward world-wide integrative decision making by stewarding the strategic application and coherent evolution of Convergent Facilitation, while caring with rigor for its integrity and anchoring in nonviolence and liberation from within NGL.*

#### Goals
- To build and maintain the platforms for people to learn, practice and teach Convergent Facilitation across the globe
- To care for the energy and flow in the community
- To support individuals in finding their way into the community
- To invite financial gifts and other resources into the community
- To spread the news about offerings
