# What can you do?


We want to make collaboration and learning easy for everyone in the Convergent Facilitation community. We invite you to ask for what you need, offer what you can contribute, and initiate whatever you want to see happening and believe will support us. We hope this guides provides some information to help you orient and inspire you to take action.

We currently envision three different spheres for people to engage with Convergent Facilitation. The outer and most accessible sphere is the _Experience and Embody_ sphere. It's focus lies on learning with existing resources and bring Convergent Facilitation into whatever you are already doing in your life. The _Apply and Apprentice_ sphere asks for deeper engagement with the Convergent Facilitation community and focuses using our own challenges to create new Convergent Facilitation resources. Finally, the _Teach and Steward_ is the one that holds Convergent Facilitation as a whole by cares for its integrity and stewarding its development and application.
