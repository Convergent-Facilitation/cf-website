# Propose changes and additions to the Website

:construction: :seedling: **WORK IN PROGRESS**  :seedling: :construction:

## How the Website is set up

We are using a framework called [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) for this website. It is a so called static website builder that creates HTML files from primarily simple text files written in markdown format. All the code and content for this website are stored in a so called repository. Anyone on the internet can view and duplicate the repository and propose changes or additions to it—including you! This can we correcting a typo or adding an entire new page or blog post.


Here are a few resources if you want to dive in more deeply:
- Learn more about how to write in markdown :point_right: [Markdown Basic Syntax Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- Take a look at the raw text file from which this particular page is created :point_right: https://github.com/Convergent-Facilitation/cf-website/blob/main/engage/platforms-and-co-creation/edit-the-website.mdx
- Explore the repository for this website :point_right: https://github.com/Convergent-Facilitation/cf-website/tree/main

## How you can propose changes or additions to this website

### Get Access to the Website's repository on Github 

- Create an account on Github if you don't yet have one (it's free) :point_right: https://github.com/signup
	- Pick the *Free* version when prompted for it (this is entirely sufficient for this purpose)
- Reach out to our CF Tech team at tech@convergentfacilitation.org and share with them the email address with which you've signed up to Github
	- :hourglass_flowing_sand: Wait until you've been added as member to the repository (you will get an email to the provided address)

Done. This is all that's needed to propose changes to the website.


### Find the place where you want to make a change

There's multiple ways for you to get to the place where you want add pages or suggest edits to current pages.

1. **Navigate repository**: You can go to this website's repository and navigate through the folder structure to find what you are looking for: https://github.com/Convergent-Facilitation/cf-website/
	- Some sections like `blog`, `events`, `resources` are easy to find and the structure is mostly self-explanatory
	- Other places like the landing page or the About/Give/Contact pages are more difficult to find
		- Landing page you will find under `src/pages/index.tsx`
			- The features section ("What makes CF powerful") on the landing page is sourced from `src/data/features.tsx`
		- The About/Give/Contact pages you will all find under `src/pages/about.mdx` / `src/pages/give.mdx` / `src/pages/concact.mdx`, respectively.
2. **Use edit buttons**: For some sections (`blog`, `events`, `resources`) you will find an `✏ Edit this page` button at the bottom of each page. Click that button and it will get you directly to the underlying file of that page.
	- Try this now: Scroll down :point_down: to the bottom of this page and click that button.
